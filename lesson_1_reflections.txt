How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped pinpoint the lines that were different. 


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If old code needs to be recycled, it can be retrieved from an older version. Also if the user wants to try out a new version of the code, this can be done without having to comment the old parts out.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros
More meaningful versions

Cons
Must put thought into saving at meaningful intervals


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is more coding-oriented and Google Doc is more intended for all files in general. In most cases outside of coding, it would not make sense to save multiple files in one commit
